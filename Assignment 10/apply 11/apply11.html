        <p>Good credit is needed for many things in life: buying a house or car, applying for a loan, sending your kids to school, and numerous other things. It's very easy to let credit go out of hand, causin gyou to spiral into debt. There are many ways to build good credit or even recover bad credit, and here are just a few examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only borrow what you can afford.</li>
            <li>Use only a portion of the credit you have available.</li>
            <li>Start with one credit card.</li>
            <li>Pay your balance in full.</li>
            <li>Make your payments on time.</li>
            <li>If you maintain a balance, do it the smart way.</li>
            <li>Let your accounts age.</li>
        </ul>
